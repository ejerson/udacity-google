Prior to ES6, the old way to concatenate strings
together was by using the string concatenation operator ( + ).

As an alternative to using the string concatenation
operator ( + ), you can use the String's concat() method,
but both options are rather clunky for
simulating true string interpolation.

TEMPLATE LITERALS  are essentially string literals
that include embedded expressions.

  * use backticks (``) instead of quotes(''/"")
  * can contain place holder using ${expression}
  * preserves newlines as part of the string.

let message = `${student.name} please see ${teacher.name} in ${teacher.room} to pick up your report card.`;

const myName = '[NAME]';
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${myName}`;
console.log(greeting);
