IMAGES: less pixels and highest compression possible = less bytes.
    1. Use max-width to adjust for larger viewport
    2. width: calc((100% - 10px)/2);
          ==> Great way to combine absolute and relative values
    3. SVG (vector image) is better for responsive designs
    4. Raster is pixel based (use webP)
    5. USE JPEG for images and SVG for Vector Images
    5. If I can't use SVG use PNG
