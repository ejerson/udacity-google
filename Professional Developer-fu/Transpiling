1. Transpiling
      * use a transpiler to convert Java to JavaScript.

2. Babel | converts ES6(ES2015) to ES5, JSX to JavaScript, and Flow to JavaScript.
      * transform code from one language to another through plugins
      http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/
      * presets are useful because they contain a group of plugins ready to be used
      * ES2015 preset contains all the plugins I need to convert ES6 to ES5

3. .babelrc | where I'd put the plugins and/or presets that my project uses

      {
          "presets": ["es2015"]
      }

4. Must have node installed, which automatically installs NPM

IMPORTANT: Stay on top of all the changes that is happening in JavaScript.
