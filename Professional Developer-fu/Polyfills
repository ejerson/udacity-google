      if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
        String.prototype.startsWith = function (searchString, position) {
          position = position || 0;
          return this.substr(position, searchString.length) === searchString;
        };
      }


      NOTE: (!String.prototype.startsWith) is used to avoid overriding the
      native statsWith method.
