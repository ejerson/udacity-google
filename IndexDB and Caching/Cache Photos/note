1. can only read a given response once - this is because the original data is gone
   keeping data in memory is a waste
        response.json();
        response.blob(); // can't read it like this anymore since
        its been read above as json

        same reasoning as above
        event.responseWith(response); // can't read it again

2. caching photos | open a cache, fetch from the network, and then
   send the response to both the cache and back to the browser

    event.responseWith(
        cache.open('wittr-content-imgs').then(function(cache) {
            return fetch(request).then(function(response) {
                // clone the response
                cache.put(request, response.clone());
            });
        })
    );
