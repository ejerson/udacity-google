1. WeakSet vs. normal Set
      * can only contain objects
      * not iterable, cannot be looped over
      * does not have a .clear() method
      * adding something other than an object will cause an ERROR!!!
      // Uncaught TypeError: Invalid value used in weak set(â€¦)

2. Creating a WeakSet is the same as a normal Set

      const roster = new WeakSet([student1, student2, student3]);
      console.log(roster);

3. WeakSet advantages,

      * JavaScript garbage collection can automatically remove
      objects inside a WeakSet

      student3 = null; // makes this object eligible for GB.
      console.log(roster);
