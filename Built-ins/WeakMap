1. WeakMap vs Map
      * can only contain objects as keys
      * not iterable, can't be looped
      * doesn't have .clear(), GB will take care of emptying it
      * takes advantage of GB to remove unused objects

2. Sample WeakMap
      const book1 = { title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen' };

      const library = new WeakMap();
      library.set(book1, true);

      console.log(library);
      // WeakMap {Object {title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen'} => true }

      NOTE: error if you try to add something other than an object as key
