1. Promise object | used for deferred and asynchronous computations. -MDN
      * no way to know when an asynchronous request will finish

2. Asynchronous requests | involves network requests, events,
   thread, or elapsed time

3. Callbacks | the default javascript technique to do asynchronous work

4. Four States of Promise
      1. Fulfilled(Resolved) | action succeeded
      2. Rejected | action failed
      3. Pending | action has not yet finished
      4. Settled | promise has either been fulfilled or rejected

NOTE: It is best practice to assume that any operation could fail at any time!

AVOID: Pyramid of Doom (highly nested callbacks), use promises instead.
