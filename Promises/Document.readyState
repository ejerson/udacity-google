1. loading
      * document is still loading
2. interactive
      * document has been loaded and parsed
      * sub-resources (css and images) still needs  to load
      * useful to create promise here if I want to run code
      when the initial elements have been loaded
3. complete
      * everything is loaded!

4. every time ready state changes, a ready state event fires
