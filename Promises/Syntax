1. Promise is a try-catch wrapper around code that will finish at
  unpredictable times.
    * promise is a constructor
    * can store in a variable or not
    * pass a function with two arguments (resolve and reject are two callbacks)
    * any value passed to resolve or reject will be received as the subsequent
    value for .then or .catch
    * if a promise is passed onto resolve or reject, the promise executes first!
