1. Even listener that is set after an even has fired is never called.
    * an event can fire many times

2. Promise
      * a promise can only settle once
      * happens in the main thread, and potentially blocking
      * use for ajax requests
      * use for Worker

      new Promise(function(resolve, rejected) {
          resolve('hi'); // works!
          resolve('bye'); // can't happen a second time
      });
